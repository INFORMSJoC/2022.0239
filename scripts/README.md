# Script for sample replication

Here are the script and source codes needed to replicate the fat polygon of Figure 12 and the 500-gon ill-behaved example of Figure 13 in the paper "Largest Volume Inscribed Rectangles in Convex Sets Defined by Finite Number of Inequalities".

In some functions cvx is used. The package is free to use and can be found here: https://github.com/cvxr/cvx .
You could also replace it with any other convex optimization package.
