# Source Codes

Here are the source codes for "Largest Volume Inscribed Rectangles in Convex Sets Defined by Finite Number of Inequalities".

In some functions cvx is used. You could replace it with any other convex optimization package.

File LIR_param_f.m is the main file. This function finds the Largest Inscibed Rectangle inside a polygon (ellipse or other convex bodies) and returns its volume and its ratio to the volume of the polygon (convex body).
