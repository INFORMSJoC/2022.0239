# Description of Results 

ft-1 shows the whole range of tangent of theta.
ft-2 shows the search with more percesion in the neighborhood of the optimal solution.
Increase the granularity of theta in the 500gonExample to see the ill-behaved objective function with the same details as in the paper.

Other results from the paper are also provided. For further discussion on the results see the paper "Largest Volume Inscribed Rectangles in Convex Sets Defined by Finite Number of Inequalities".
