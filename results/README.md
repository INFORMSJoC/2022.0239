# Description of Results 

As an example to clarify the results and figures in the paper "Largest Volume Inscribed Rectangles in Convex Sets Defined by Finite Number of Inequalities", the results of the ill-behaved 500-gon example are exaplained here. 

The picture ft-1 shows the whole range of tangent of theta.
ft-2 shows the results of the search with more precision in the neighborhood of the optimal solution.
Increase the granularity of theta in the 500gonExample to see the ill-behaved objective function with the same details as in the paper.

Other results from the paper are also provided. For further discussion on the results see the paper .
